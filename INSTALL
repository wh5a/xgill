Building and Installing sixgill

sixgill has a GNU-style configure script, which checks for support elements
and enables additional features if they are available. The easiest way
to build sixgill is:

1. Unpack the distribution tarball
2. Run "./configure" and check the output
3. Run "make" to build the various parts of sixgill

There are three key dependencies - GCC, CVC3 and Yices

A. GCC front end support

sixgill includes a frontend plugin for GCC version 4.5. Currently,
GCC 4.5 is not released, so you will need to build it from SVN.

If you get a configure summary that includes a line like:
           * GCC Plugin:                no
then you need to make sure that the gcc executable in your path really is
GCC 4.5, for example by using "gcc --version" on the command line.

If your build fails with an error about PLUGIN_FINISH_DECL not being found,
then you need to patch your GCC and rebuild it. The patch is at
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2009-12/msg01032.html

B. CVC3

CVC3 is packaged on many modern distributions, and you can just use the 
distribution packages if they are available. Note that you will need the 
-devel packages if your distribution splits things up that way.
If CVC3 is not available as packages, you can obtain CVC3 from:
http://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/download.html

If you install CVC3 into a non-standard location, then you may need to
adjust the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS provided to the "configure" script to 
ensure it is found.

C. Yices

Yices is not Free software, so it is unlikely your distribution has it.
If you want to use it, you can obtain it from:
http://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml
(note: Yices, not Yices2, is required)

You need to tell the configure script where the unpacked tree is, using:
./configure --with-yices=/path/to/yices-1.0.26
(using the actual path where you unpacked yices).
