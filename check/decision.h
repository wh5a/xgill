// the checker will attempt an exhaustive enumeration of the program's
// possible behaviors when trying to prove an assertion. while the order
// it performs this enumeration could affect whether it finds a report
// rather than an incomplete, this order will not affect whether it is able
// to check the assertion successfully. however, there are points during
// its execution where it can make a decision about *how* to try to prove
// the property. once made these decisions cannot be undone, and the decision
// made often determines whether the checker will quickly prove the assertion,
// or just spin off and give back incomplete.

// since the checker is deterministic, we can model the possible decisions
// it could make during its execution with a binary tree whose children
// represent the decisions that will be made if it decides yes/no at
// a particular point. during checking, we will perform a breadth-first search
// of the nodes in this decision tree, until we check the assertion holds,
// get a report or run out of time.

// unique identifier for decisions. as with checker frames, these can
// be used by decision points to refer to one another. 0 refers to
// a non-existent decision point.
